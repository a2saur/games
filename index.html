            <p>Welcome to A2 Games!<br>
            Please enjoy!</p>
            <p>
                This is my website of games! <br> 
                There are 3 groupings of games; Completed, Work in Progress, and Physics <br>
                Some of the Work in Progress games don't work, so they wouldn't be fun games to play. <br>
                The Physics category contains physics simulators. You can play around with them, but they aren't as polished. <br>
                Finally, the Completed category contains completed games that you can play, although they may get updated in the future. There are minigames and full games to play!<br>
                <br><b><u>About the individual games</u></b><br>
                <br><b>Field of Geese</b><br>
                In a field full of geese, how far can you get?<br>
                In this minigame, dodge geese for as long as you can!<br>
                <i>-----Keys-----</i><br>
                Use the <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>left</b>, and <b>right</b> keys to move around.<br>
                Pressing a key starts moving in that direction stops it (ex: press up to start going up and down to stop going up)<br>
                <br>

                <br><b>A Goose's Field</b><br>
                The sequel to Field of Geese, this minigame uses the same keys to move around.<br>
                However, this time you're... a goose?<br>
                Try to catch the children (they will run away if you get too close!) and maybe they'll drop some good food...<br>
                <i>-----Keys-----</i><br>
                Use the <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>left</b>, and <b>right</b> keys to move around.<br>
                Pressing a key starts moving in that direction stops it (ex: press up to start going up and down to stop going up)<br>
                <br>
                
                <br><b>Collection Game</b><br>
                In this game, you can explore the area and find various creatures!<br>
                There are 4 types of land: Mountain, Grass, Beach, and Water<br>
                You can find various towns in the game, and talk to the villagers as well as sell items in the shop.<br>
                <b>Note:</b> This game takes place on a randomly generated map! (Pretty cool right?)<br>
                <i>-----Keys-----</i><br>
                Use the <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>left</b>, and <b>right</b> keys to move around.<br>
                Use the <b>space</b> key to select something (to talk to a villager or select an option) and the <b>enter</b> key to finish selling items in the shop<br>
                <br>
                
                <br><b>Penguin Poopers</b><br>
                Uh oh, these penguins keep pooping!<br>
                In this minigame, try to keep your side clean by turning the penguins when there about to poo!<br>
                The more times your side gets hit, the more dirty it gets!<br>
                <b>Note:</b> There is no end to the game, so play as long as you'd like!<br>
                <i>-----Keys-----</i><br>
                <b>Player 1</b>: Use the <b>left</b>, and <b>right</b> keys to move around and <b>up</b> key to turn your penguin<br>
                <b>Player 2</b>: Use the <b>a</b>, and <b>d</b> keys to move around and <b>w</b> key to turn your penguin<br>
                <br>
